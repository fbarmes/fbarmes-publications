\subsection{The rod-sphere potential.}
\label{ss:RSP_potential}

The rod-sphere surface potential (RSP) describes the interaction between a Gaussian ellipsoid and a
sphere located in the surface plane and with the same $x$ and $y$ coordinates as the ellipsoid. 
Again, the particles (HGO) do not interact directly with the substrate, rather another
HGO ellipsoid is inserted in each particle (\eg Figure~\ref{fig:RSPConfig}). 
This inner ellipsoid interacts with the surface through $\mathcal{V}^{RSP}$ as~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{V}^{RSP} = \left\{	%}
	\begin{array}{ccc}
		0	&\mathrm{if}	&|z_i - z_0| \geq \sigma^{RSP}_w	\\
		\infty	&\mathrm{if}	&|z_i - z_0| < \sigma^{RSP}_w	
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}
%
where $\sigma^{RSP}_w$ is the contact distance for the interaction between a hard Gaussian 
overlap particle  with length $\sigma_\parallel$ and breadth $\sigma_\perp$ and a sphere of diameter 
$\sigma_j$. The contact distance for such an interaction is given by Equation 
(4) of~\cite{BernePechukas72}~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^{RSP}_w = \sqrt{
	\frac{\sigma^2_\perp + \sigma^2_j}
	{1 - \chi(\dotproduct{u_i}{r_{ij}})^2 }
	}
	\label{eqn:sw_RSP_BP}
\end{equation}

For the implementation into a simulation code, Equation~\ref{eqn:sw_RSP_BP} is best written
in terms of $\theta$ and $\sigma_0$~; recalling that the unit of distance 
$\so = \sigma_\perp\sqrt{2}$ and for convenience, imposing $\so = \sigma_j\sqrt{2}$. 
Also to enable
comparison with the hard needle wall potential, the sphere is taken to be tangent with the
substrate so as to keep it out of the simulation box. This leads to the final expression for
$\sigma^{RSP}_w$ as used in the simulations~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^{RSP}_w = \sigma_0\lp \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \chi_S\cos^2\theta}} - \frac{1}{2} \rp
	\label{eqn:sigma_w_RSP}
\end{equation}
%
with~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\chi_S = \frac{k^2_S - 1}{k^2_S + 1}
\end{equation}
%
$k_S$ being the length to breadth ratio of the inner ellipsoid. A graphical representation of
this contact distance  as a function of $k_S$ and $\theta$ is shown on
Figure~\ref{fig:sw_RSP}.\\

%------------------------------------------

The rod-sphere model has already been used as the contact distance for a soft surface potential in 
studies of confined Gay-Berne particles in single component
systems~\cite{WallCleaver97}~\remark{[Zhang \etal, PRE, 1996]}, 
binary mixtures~\cite{LathamCleaver00} and switching situations~\cite{rwThesis}. 
In all of these, full particles (\ie $k_S = k$) were used and tilted layers were observed in the
interfacial regions.
In~\cite{WallCleaver97} the tilt was explained to be a consequence of the competition 
between packing constraints and the form of the surface potential. In other words, the attractive 
part of the potential was thought to be responsible for the tilt, the authors noticing that increasing 
the  particle-surface coupling $\alpha$ (see equation (9) of~\cite{WallCleaver97}) induced a tighter 
distribution of the particles orientation about the optimal tilt angle.
Ascribing the tilt to the attractive part of the potential was also consistent with the many
theoretical treatements of confined hard particle systems~: none of these predict tilted surface
alignment~\remark{[refs for this]}.\\


Here, the origins of this tilting behaviour are revisited by studying the surface induced 
changes as  a function of $k_S$. In Appendix~\remark{A}, it is shown that a particle with 
elongation $k$ whose inner 
ellipsoid is in contact with the substrate surface, the volume $Ve(k_S,\theta)$ absorbed into 
the surface is given by~:
%
\begin{equation}
	Ve=\frac{1}{3}\pi\lp \frac{1}{2}-\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{RSP}_w}{k^2\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta}}\rp^2 
	\lp 1 + \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^{RSP}_w}{k^2\cos^2\theta+\sin^2\theta}} \rp
	\label{eqn:Ve_RSP}
\end{equation}
%
A graphical representation of this absorbed volume is given in Figure~\ref{fig:Ve_RSP_fkS} 
for a particle of
elongation $k=3$.  The prefered surface induced arrangements can be associated with the 
maxima in $Ve(k_S,\theta)$. For short $k_S$, $Ve(k_S,\theta)$ is maximal at $\theta = 0$ 
and, therefore, the most stable arrangement is homeotropic. In the limit of $k_S=k$, however
$Ve(k_S,\theta)$ is maximal  for intermediate $\theta$, which suggests that a tilted 
arrangement may be most stable.\\
%

More insight into the origins of this result can be found in the expression of the surface potential
(Equation~\ref{eqn:sigma_w_RSP}). In the case $k_S=k$, $\sigma^{HNW}_w$ 
represents the distance from the substrate to the particle's centre of mass when one of its
needle's ends
is in contact with the surface.  $\sigma^{RSP}_w$, in contrast, 
indicates whether or not the HGO particle overlaps the sphere embedded whithin the substrate.\\
The comparison between the two potentials (Figure~\ref{fig:cmpHNW_RSP})
shows that there are some tilt angle for which $\sigma^{RSP}_w$ is smaller than $\sigma^{HNW}_w$, 
that is the particle ends are able to overlap the surface. This region of reduced 
$\sigma^{RSP}_w$  coincides with the maximum in $Ve(k_s,\theta)$ and, therefore, can be related
to any tilt behaviour.\\

The optimum tilt angle $\theta_{tilt}$ for which the adsorbed volume of one particle is maximal can be
calculated for different values of k.  By considering the absorbed volume given by 
Equation~\ref{eqn:Ve_RSP} and setting $k_S=k$, an expression
for $Ve(k,\theta)$ (Figure~\ref{fig:Ve_RSP_fk}) can be obtained.
$\theta_{tilt}$, the angle which maximizes $Ve(k,\theta)$, is the angle that
solves~:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d}{d\theta}Ve(k,\theta) = 0
	\label{eqn:dVeEq}
\end{equation}
%
where $\frac{d}{d\theta}Ve(k,\theta)$ is given by~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d}{d\theta}Ve(k,\theta) = k\pi \lp\frac{A_0\lp B_0 + C_0 \rp}{D_0} 
	-\frac{A_0 F_0 \lp B_0 + C_0 \rp}{I_0} 
	\rp
\end{equation}
%
there~:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
	A_0 &=& \lp \frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{A^2}{B}} \rp^2	\\
	B_0 &=& -\frac{A^2\lp2\cos\theta\sin\theta - 2k^2\cos\theta\sin\theta\rp}{B^2}	\\
	C_0 &=& -\frac{2A(k^2-1)\cos\theta \sin\theta}{(k^2+1)BC^\frac{3}{2}}	\\
	D_0 &=& 6\sqrt{\frac{A^2}{B}}	\\
	F_0 &=& 1+\sqrt{\frac{A^2}{B}}	\\
	I_0 &=& 3\sqrt{\frac{A^2}{B}}
\end{eqnarray*}
%
and~:
%
\begin{eqnarray*}
	A &=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{C}} - \frac{1}{2}	\\
	B &=& k^2\cos\theta + \sin^2\theta	\\
	C &=& 1 - \frac{(k^2-1)\cos^2\theta}{1+k^2}\\
\end{eqnarray*}

	\label{fig:dVeContour_RSP_fk}
\end{figure}
%=================================


Equation~\ref{eqn:dVeEq} has been solved numerically by computing the contour of 
$\frac{d}{d\theta}Ve(k,\theta)$ at level $0$ as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:dVeContour_RSP_fk}. 
This shows that $\theta_{tilt}$ is fairly constant at about 0.9 radians, 
that is about $50$ degrees.
As a result, configurations with a tilt angle of about $50$ degrees are expected to be favored
from simulations
of HGO with the RSP potential and full particles. However, as many body effects have not been
considered here, the existence of such a tilt in a bulk system cannot be assumed.

\subsection{Simulation results using the RSP.}

Surface induced structural changes obtained using the RSP surface potential have been investigated using
Monte Carlo computer simulations in the canonical ensemble. Systems of $N=1000$ hard Gaussian overlap
particles with elongation $k=3$ confined in an infinitely wide slab geometry of fixed height 
$L_z=4k\sigma_0$ were considered, the walls being situated at $z_0 = \pm\frac{L_z}{2}$ and
symmetric anchoring conditions applied. The simulations were performed in a sequence of decreasing 
$k_S$ and the surface induced structural changes were studied using the observable 
profiles ($\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$, $Q_{zz}(z)$ and $P_2(z)$) introduced in the previous Chapter. 
From these profiles, the
anchoring and order phase diagrams were computed in the interfacial and bulk regions.\\

Typical profiles obtained using this alternative surface potential are shown on 
Figures~\ref{fig:RSP_typeProf_k3_planar} and~\ref{fig:RSP_typeProf_k3_homeo}.
These profiles, share some of the features of the equivalent profiles obtained with the HNW
potential. The case $k^\prime_S = 0.0$ clearly induces a homeotropic arrangement as can be observed
from the positive values of $Q_{zz}(z)$ and the wavelength of the oscillations of $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ 
of about $\sel$.
Also the quality of in-plane ordering is similar to that observed previously.\\
%
For $k^\prime_S = 1.0$, however, the situation is very different, and there is little similarity 
with the $\kSp = 1$ HNW profiles.
The layering shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RSP_typeProf_k3_planar} is not as well defined and only two peaks 
in $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ can  be clearly observed. Moreover the peak separation is much larger than
$\so$. 
Also $Q_{zz}(z)$ fails to display the negative values that would suggest planar ordering, 
even at high densities. Since the corresponding $P_2(z)$ profiles indicates an ordered
phase, it can be concluded that, in this case, a tilted arrangement is adopted as suggested by
the analysis made in Section~\ref{ss:RSP_potential}~\remark{change this}. This Conclusion is
confirmed by the configuration snapshots shown in Figure~\ref{fig:RSP_snaps}\\
%
The tilt angle is not readily available from these profiles, however at the
location where $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ is maximal, $Q_{zz} = 0.209$. From the definition
of $Q_{\alpha\beta}$, this corresponds to an average tilt angle of $46.6^\circ$, that is $0.812$
radian which is slightly lower than the predicted tilt angle~\remark{How did you do this}. 
The configuration snapshot for 
$k^{'}_S = 1.0$ and $\rho^{*} = 0.35$ (Figure~\ref{fig:RSP_snaps}(b) )shows a tilt 
angle compatible with the above statements.
%
The difference between the observed and predicted tilt angles (of $9.7\%$) can be understood from the 
packing constraints. The packing improves with lower tilt angles which can in turn can
increases the adsorbed volume. However the adsorbed volume of one particle decreases as the
difference between its optimal and actual tilt angles increases. This creates a competition 
between the amount of adsorbed volume that can be obtained with a better packing fraction 
but lower average tilt angle and that obtained with an average tilt angle closer to the 
optimal angle but lower packing fraction.\\
%
These simulations have shown that by considering only the adsorbed volume, that is entropy, 
a tilted phase can be predicted and obtained with steric model. This denies the explanation made
in~\cite{WallCleaver97}.\\

Because the periodicity in $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ has changed with this model, another convention for
the location of the boundary between the surface and bulk regions of the cell needs to be
adopted. As the primary peaks in $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ are always situated at $|z-z_i|> 0.0$, 
the surface region has been defined to extend from the substrate to the location of the second 
maximum  in $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ regardless of the surface arrangement. This method is consistent
with the fact that no true planar arrangement has been observed and that the periodicity of 
$\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ for the homeotropic and tilted arrangements are fairly close to one another.\\
%
This convention has been used for the computation of the anchoring and order phase diagrams as
shown on Figures~\ref{fig:RSP_QzzWa} and~\ref{fig:RSP_QzzWa}.
Since the bistability in the anchoring transition between the two observed phases is not of 
interest here, only series with decreasing $k^\prime_S$ have been performed.
