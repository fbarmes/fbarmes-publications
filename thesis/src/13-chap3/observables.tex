In this Section, the computational details are given for the calculation of the most important
observables considered in this thesis. First, the observables used for the measurement of positional 
order are considered, followed by those related to orientational order. This section closes on the
computation of observables profiles for the study of confined systems.

\subsubsection{The radial pair distribution function~: $g(r)$}


The pair distribution function $g(r)$ is of great importance in the molecular simulations of
fluids as it provides detailed insight into the structure of the
studied phase. $g(r)$ represents the probability of finding a pair of particles $i$ and $j$ with
an intermolecular separation $r_{ij}$.  As a result, quantitative insight into the the nature 
of the studied phase (gas-liquid-solid) and the  positional correlations of the particles
can be obtained using $g(r)$. This function can be expressed as~\cite{AandT}~:
\begin{equation}
        g(r) = \frac{V}{N^2} \left< \sum_{i}\sum_{j\neq i} \delta(r - r_{ij}) \right>
\end{equation}
%
Where $\delta(r-r_{ij})$ is a function which is non zero over a given interval, $V$ is the volume and 
$N$ the number of particles.\\

	purposes, part of the volume has been excised.}
	\label{fig:g(r)SphericalShells}
\end{figure}

Within the course of a simulation, $g(r)$ is constructed by computing an histogram of all pair
separations $r_{ij}\in[r: r+\delta r]$ where $r \in [0:\frac{L_\mrm{min}}{2}]$ and 
$L_\mrm{min}$ is the shortest simulation box length. The histogram bin heights represent 
the average particle occupancies in concentric spherical shells around any particle taken as 
the reference (see Figure~\ref{fig:g(r)SphericalShells}). In order to obtain $g(r)$, the 
histogram must be normalized  by the average expected occupancy of an ideal gas at 
the same density. This implies that the histogram bin corresponding to a distance $r$, must 
be normalized by $\rho^{*}V_\mrm{shell}(r)$  where $\rho^{*}$ is the number density of 
the fluid and $V_\mrm{shell}(r)$ is the volume between two spheres of radius $r$ and $r+\delta
r$. The volume $V_\mrm{shell}(r)$ is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:g(r)SphericalShells} 
and is given by~:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
	V_\mrm{shell} &=& \frac{4}{3}\pi\left[ (r+\delta r)^3 - r^3 \right]	\nonumber \\
	V_\mrm{shell} &=& \frac{4}{3}\pi\left[ (\delta r)^3 + 3r^2\delta r + 3r(\delta r)^2\right]
\end{eqnarray}

To obtain of smooth functions requires the computation of an average $g(r)$ from several
uncorrelated configurations. This in turns, implies that the histogram must also be normalized by
$N_\mrm{call}$, the number of configurations used. Also the histogram must be normalized by $N$,
the number of particles used so as to make it system-size independent. As a result the 
total normalization coefficient is given by~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	f_\mrm{norm} &=& \lp N N_\mrm{call}\rho^{*} V_\mrm{shell} \rp^{-1}	\nonumber \\
	f_\mrm{norm} &=& (3V)
	\left\{ 4N^2N_\mrm{call}\pi\left[ (\delta r)^3 + 3r^2\delta r + 3r(\delta
	r)^2\right] \right\}^{-1}
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Projections of $g(r)$~: $g_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and $g_\perp(r_\perp)$}

In the case of liquid crystalline phases, the anisotropic nature of the fluid can make it
necessary to consider 
different distribution functions in different directions of space. For instance, the 
distributions functions resolved parallel and perpendicular to the director, namely 
$g_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and $g_\perp(r_\perp)$, are of great utility in the study of 
smectic phases. The former measures the degree of layering in the sample while the latter
measures the intra-layer positional order.\\

\picW = 7.2cm
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\subfigure[$g_\parallel(r_\parallel)$]{\pic{grParallelShells.ps}}
	\subfigure[$g_\perp(r_\perp)$]{\pic{grPerpShells.ps}}
	\caption{Representation of the volumes corresponding to a cylindrical shell between the
	distances $r$ and $r+\delta r$ as used for the computation of 
	$g_\parallel(r_\parallel)$(a) and $g_\perp(r_\perp)$(b). For clarity
	purposes, part of the volume has been excised.}
	\label{fig:gp(r)CylinderShells}
\end{figure}

The approach used in the computation of $g_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and $g_\perp(r_\perp)$ is 
very similar to that used for
$g(r)$. Here histograms of the projection of $\vect{r_{ij}}$
parallel ($r_\parallel = \dotProd{\vecth{n}}{\vect{r_{ij}}}$) and perpendicular 
($r_\perp = \sqrt{r_{ij}^2 - r_\parallel^2 }$) to the director $\vecth{n}$ are considered. In
order to simplify the normalization process, the histograms are computed within a cylindrical
geometry as shown on Figure~\ref{fig:gp(r)CylinderShells}. Again, the histograms are normalized
by $\rho^{*}V_\mrm{shell}$, the expected average occupancy of a shell of an ideal gas, 
$N_\mrm{call}$ and $N$. However, because a cylinder is considered, the expression for
$V_\mrm{shell}$ is different. This is given for each of the functions as~:
%
\begin{equation}
V_\mrm{shell} = \left\{ %}
\begin{array}{ccc}
	\pi r^2 \delta r	 &\mrm{\ for\ } &g_\parallel(r_\parallel)	\\
	h_\mrm{cyl} \pi \left[ (\delta r)^2 + 2r\delta r  \right] &\mrm{\ for\ } &g_\perp(r_\perp)	
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

	P taking $h_\mrm{cyl}=L_\mrm{min}$.}
	\label{fig:cylGeometry}
\end{figure}
%------------------------------

where $h_\mrm{cyl}$ represents the height of the cylinder in which the computation is performed.
The size of the cylinder must be chosen so as to be smaller than the simulation box but large
enough to consider as wide a region as possible. The chosen method sets the cylinder height
to $h_\mrm{cyl} = 0.8L_\mrm{min}$. The cylinder radius $r_\mrm{cyl}$ is then chosen so that 
the cylinder would just fit in a cubic box of size $L_\mrm{min}$ if $h_\mrm{cyl} = L_\mrm{min}$
(See Figure~\ref{fig:cylGeometry}). Therefore the size of the cylinder is~:
\begin{eqnarray}
	h_\mrm{cyl} &=& 0.8 L_\mrm{min}	\\
	r_\mrm{cyl} &=& b\tan\alpha	
\end{eqnarray}

where $b$ and $\alpha$ are shown on Figure~\ref{fig:cylGeometry} and are given by~:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	b &=& \frac{L_\mrm{min} \lp \sqrt{3}-1 \rp}{2}	\\
	\alpha &=& \arccos\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}
\end{eqnarray*}


%-------------------------------------------
%-------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Molecule-based projections of $g(r)$~: 
$g^\mrm{mol}_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and $g^\mrm{mol}_\perp(r_\perp)$}

In ordered systems where the particles form layers which are not parallel with one another, taking
the director $\vecth{n}$ as the reference for the computation of the pair correlation functions
becomes irrelevant. Rather an alternative scheme which allows to `follow' the layers is needed.
This is obtained by the use of $g^\mrm{mol}_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and
$g^\mrm{mol}_\perp(r_\perp)$ which give the pair correlation functions parallel and
perpendicular to the molecular orientation rather than $\vecth{n}$. In practice, these histograms 
are computed for every pair of particles $i$ and $j$ taking $\ui$ as the reference. 
$r_\parallel$ and $r_\perp$ are then defined as~:
%
\begin{eqnarray}
	r_\parallel &=& \dotProd{\ui}{\vect{r_{ij}}}	\\
	r_\perp &=& \sqrt{r_{ij}^2 - r_\parallel^2 }
\end{eqnarray}
%
The same cylinder geometry is used as for the computation of $g^\mrm{mol}_\parallel(r_\parallel)$ and
$g^\mrm{mol}_\perp(r_\perp)$, the difference being that its orientation changes according to which
particle $i$ is being considered.

\subsection{Orientational order}
\label{ss:P2}

%------------------------------------------------------
%------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Nematic order parameter.}

The liquid crystalline phase can be characterized partly through the long range orientational
order of the molecules; this triggers the need for an appropriate order parameter so as to
quantify the degree of order in a given phase. Ideally this order parameter should have a value
of zero for a phase with an isotropic distribution of molecular orientations and a value of 
one for a phase with perfect alignment.\\

Experimentally, an appropriate definition for this is the so called nematic order parameter
$P_2$~\cite{Intro_LC} which is the average over all particles of the second order Legendre polynomial 
in $\cos\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle between every molecule and the 
director $\vecth{n}$~\cite{Intro_LC}.
\begin{eqnarray}
	P_2 &=& \left< P_2(\cos\alpha)  \right>_\mrm{particles}	\\
	P_2 &=& \left< \frac{3}{2}\cos^2\alpha - \frac{1}{2} \right>_\mrm{particles}
\end{eqnarray}
Also, the nature of $P_2(\cos\alpha)$ involving $\cos^2\alpha$ implies that the nematic order
parameter does not differentiate particles with orientations $\ui$ and $-\ui$.\\

Within the scope of computer simulations, the computation of $P_2$ and, thus, its run average
\Ptwo is not trivial. However it can be shown~\cite{EppengaFrenkel84,AdvCpuSimsLiqCryst2}
that the problem can be reduced to the diagonalisation of the ordering matrix 
$Q_{\alpha\beta}$, a traceless second order tensor defined as~:
%
\begin{equation}
	Q_{\alpha\beta} = \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{N} \left\{ 
		3u_{i,\alpha}u_{i,\beta} - \delta_{\alpha\beta} \right\}
\end{equation}
%
where $\delta_{\alpha\beta}$ is the Kroeneker function. The order parameter $P_2$ is defined 
by $\lambda_+$, the maximum Eigen value of $Q_{\alpha\beta}$~\cite{EppengaFrenkel84}. 
The director is, then, the Eigen vector associated with $\lambda_+$.\\
%
In a simulation, the nematic order parameter \Ptwo is obtained by averaging the values of 
$P_2$ obtained from a significant number of uncorrelated configurations.\\

\picW = 10cm
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\picL{P2recal_n.ps}
	\caption{Variation of the value of $\lambda_+(n)$ computed using the $\vect{Q}$ matrix method 
	for a system of $n$ particles with an isotropic distribution of orientations.}
	\label{fig:P2(n)}
\end{figure}


Eppenga and Frenkel~\cite{EppengaFrenkel84} showed that, while this method is very accurate 
for the description  of well ordered phases, the case of the less ordered phases is 
more problematic, especially for small systems. Indeed, in the case of a phase with an isotropic 
distribution of orientations, $P_2$ should be zero whereas the value of the computed 
$\lambda_+$ decays to zero  as the number of particles increases (Figure~\ref{fig:P2(n)}). 
The difference between  the computed and expected values become negligible for a particle 
numbers $N\geq\mathcal{O}(10^3)$.
%

%------------------------------------------------------
%------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Polar order parameter.}

In the case of molecules with permanent dipole moments, both the order in the system, and the
direction of $\vecth{n}$ become important. The task of differentiating $\ui$ and $-\ui$ is
achieved using the first order Legendre polynomial $P_1(\cos\alpha)=\cos\alpha$. The polar
order parameter is therefore referred to as \Pone.\\
The computation of \Pone requires the knowledge of the polar director $\vecth{n}_{P1} =
\frac{\vect{n}_{P_1}}{|\vect{n}_{P_1}|}$ with~:
\begin{equation}
	\vect{n}_{P1} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \ui.
\end{equation}
%
and the instantaneous value of $P_1$ is given by~:
\begin{equation}
	P_1 = |\vect{n}_{P_1}|
\end{equation}

The simulation averaged polar order parameter \Pone is obtained by taking the
average of the instantaneous $P_1$ values from a high enough number of uncorrelated
configurations.\\
A low polar order parameter does not necessarily indicate a disordered phase as non-polar
nematic phases usually have an equal proportion of particles with $\ui \sim \vecth{n}$ and
$\ui \sim -\vecth{n}$~; however a high value of $P_1$ does imply a high value of $P_2$.

\subsection{Observables profiles}

In confined systems, the presence of interfaces introduces structural changes
which, for a given set of thermodynamic and surface parameters, are functions of the distance 
from the substrate. As a result, a great deal of insight into surface induced effects can be
obtained through computation of observables profiles. Since it is common to consider the case of 
a slab geometry in the $\vecth{z}$ direction (such as that used in Chapter~\ref{chap:four}),
such profiles are referred to as the $z$-profiles.\\

The computation of most profiles is very straightforward; the simulation box is
divided into $N_\mrm{slice}$ virtual slices, of width $w_\mrm{slice}$ parallel to the
substrates, in which the  observables are computed independently.
The computation of the profile $\mathcal{A}(z)$ of a property $\mathcal{A}$ 
requires the computation of $\mathcal{A}$ in each slice. $\mathcal{A}(z_0)$ is obtained by
computing $\mathcal{A}$ considering only those particles whose $z$ coordinates $z_i$ are such that 
$z_i \in [z_0 - \frac{w_\mrm{slice}}{2} : z_0 + \frac{w_\mrm{slice}}{2}]$.
In the course of a simulation, smooth profiles are obtained through averaging a significant
number of instantaneous profiles (typically $500$) obtained from uncorrelated configurations.\\

The most commonly computed profiles are $\rho^{*}_\ell(z)$ and $Q_{zz}(z)$. The former
measures the variation of density across the simulation box. Its computation requires simple
division of the number of particles in a given slice by the volume of that slice.\\
%
$Q_{zz}(z)$ represents the variation of the $zz$ element of $Q_{\alpha\beta}$ across the slab.
$Q_{zz}$ measures the degree of order with respect to $\vecth{z}$, the surface normal. 
$Q_{zz} = -0.5$ for perfect
order perpendicular to $\vecth{z}$ (planar arrangement) and $Q_{zz} = 1.0$ for perfect 
order parallel to $\vecth{z}$ (homeotropic arrangement.) Again the computation of $Q_{zz}(z)$ 
is straightforward as it can be performed by considering only those particles whose centres of 
mass are located within the slice of interest.\\

In some cases however, the computation of the profiles is not straightforward. A good example
is the computation of $P_2(z)$. Here, the reduced number of particles in each slice
introduces a lack of accuracy of the computed profiles because of the $n$ dependence of
$\lambda_+$ 
as presented in Section~\ref{ss:P2}. As a result, the value of $P_2$ in a given slice at position $z_0$ 
can not be computed simply by applying the $\vect{Q}$ matrix method to those particles 
whose centres of mass lie within the slice. Rather, $P_2(z_0)$ is computed using the approach
proposed by Wall and Cleaver~\cite{WallCleaver97} and based on the original expression 
for $\lambda_+$ from~\cite{EppengaFrenkel84}~:
%
\begin{equation}
	\lambda_+ - \frac{3\lambda_+}{4n}\left[ 1 + P_2^2(n-1) \right] - \frac{P_2^3}{4}
	- \frac{3}{4n}\lp P_2^2 - P_2^3\rp - \frac{1-3P_2^2+2P_2^3}{4n^2}
\end{equation}
%
where $\lambda_+$ is the maximum Eigen value of $Q_{\alpha\beta}$ and $P_2$ denotes the true order
parameter in the slice. This can be rearranged so as to give a polynomial in $P_2$ as~:
%
\begin{equation}
	aP_2^3 + bP_2^2 + c P_2 + d = 0
	\label{eqn:P2ProfPoly}
\end{equation}
%
with~:
\begin{eqnarray*}
	a &=& -n^2 + 3n + 2			\\
	b &=& -3\lambda_+ n (n-1) - 3(n-1)	\\
	c &=& 0					\\
	d &=& 4n^2\lambda_+^3 - 3n\lambda_+ - 1
\end{eqnarray*}

$P_2(z_0)$ is then obtained by solving Equation~\ref{eqn:P2ProfPoly} taking into account the $n$
particles which belong to the slice centred at $z=z_0$. It should be noted that some special
cases must be considered. The computation is skipped if $n=0$ or $1$ as this would lead,
respectively, to a trivial solution or an incorrect value of $P_2=1$. In the case $n=2$,
Equation~\ref{eqn:P2ProfPoly} reduces to a second order polynomial with roots 
$P_2 = \pm\sqrt{-\frac{d}{b}}$.\\
%
If the roots of Equation~\ref{eqn:P2ProfPoly} are complex then an alternative scheme is 
used where $P_2 = P_2^\mrm{recal}$ with $P_2^\mrm{recal} = \lambda_+ - 
\left< \lambda^\mrm{rd}(n)\right>$. Here $\left<\lambda^\mrm{rd}(n)\right>$ is the average
$\lambda_+$ obtained from applying the $\vect{Q}$ matrix method to a high number (\eg $10^5$) of
configuration of $n$ particles with an isotropic distribution of orientations. If
$P_2^\mrm{recal} < 0$ then the computation of $P_2$ for this slice is skipped.
