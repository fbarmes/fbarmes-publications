Equation of state for hard Gaussian overlap fluids
JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS 2003, Vol 118, Iss 4, pp 1852-1858

The thermodynamic properties of hard Gaussian overlap fluids have been studied by computer
simulation using constant-pressure Monte Carlo techniques for various molecular elongations
kappa in the range 3less than or equal tokappaless than or equal to15. The work reported here
concentrates on the equation of state and the Helmholtz free energy for the isotropic and
nematic phases. Several theoretical approaches, based on the decoupling approximation, are
considered and their predictions are compared with the simulation results. According to our
results, none of these approximations yields a fully satisfactory description of the isotropic
phase. In the nematic phase, the simple Parsons-Lee approximation is the only approach that
yields results in quantitative agreement with simulation data for all elongations.

Virial coefficients for the Hard Gaussian Overlap model
INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C 1999, Vol 10, Iss 2-3, pp 361-374

Monte Carlo estimates of virial coefficients up to the sixth for the Hard Gaussian Overlap
(HGO) model are presented for values of the aspect ratio parameter kappa of the model ranging
from 0.05 to 10. The sixth coefficients are new and the lower coefficients are improvements on
previous numerical estimates. The second virials are found to be in excellent agreement with an
analytical integration reported in the literature. Pade (3, 3) approximations to the pressure
and residual Helmholtz energy were constructed. Attempts to represent coefficients in these
approximations by analytical functions of kappa were not successful due to singularities in
these functions. In the approximate range of 4.5 less than or equal to kappa less than or equal
to 5.5, the (3, 3) Pade approximations were found to be no better than lower ones. Comparisons
with available Monte Carlo simulated pressures for moderately aspherical fluids were found to be
good.

Nematic virial coefficients of very long hard molecules and Onsager theory
MOLECULAR PHYSICS 1998, Vol 94, Iss 2, pp 335-339

The virial coefficients B-2-B-5 of a fluid of hard molecules interacting via a hard Gaussian
overlap potential have been obtained by Monte Carlo integration. Molecular elongations re
ranging from 1 to 10(5) are considered. Virial coefficients are computed as a function of the
nematic order parameter S, using a simple representation for the orientational distribution
function. The calculations cover the entire order parameter range and include the limiting cases
S = 0 (randomly oriented molecules) and S = 1 (completely parallel molecular arrangements). In
analogy with results from previous studies for spherocylinders, the virial coefficients in the
case S = 0 are seen to vanish in the limit of infinitely long molecules (k --> infinity), though
the asymptotic regime sets in rather slowly. Similar asymptotic behaviour is observed even for
relatively high values of S, which implies that, for the Values where the transition to the
nematic is expected to occur and well within the nematic range, the covergence properties of the
virial expansion must be rather insensitive to the nematic order parameter. This result may
indicate that Onsager theory for the isotropic-nematic transition, a virial expansion truncated
at second order, is exact in the limit k --> infinity.
