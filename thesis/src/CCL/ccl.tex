\chapter{Conclusions and future work}



In this Thesis, the study of confined liquid crystalline systems and the development of a model 
for tapered pear shaped particles were addressed. These two seemingly
very different lines of work have subsequently been united in the study of confined pear shaped
particles which lead to towards the final aim of the Thesis: the development of a model for a 
liquid crystal display cell where switching between the two
stable states may be flexoelectricity induced. The development of this latter model required two 
conditions to be met, the first being a surface potential inducing both planar and homeotropic 
anchoring and, with  appropriate tuning of the model parameter, a bistability
region. The second requirement was that of a molecular model for flexoelectric (\ie pear shaped) 
mesogens displaying a stable nematic phase.\\
Here, the conclusions that have been drawn from this study are summarized and various avenues 
for future work are discussed.
