\label{chap:seven}

\introduction

In this Chapter, the knowledge acquired from our earlier studies of confined systems and the
development of the pear shaped PHGO model are brought together. The aim here is 
to construct a model for a liquid crystal display cell in which 
as proposed by Davidson and Mottram~\cite{DavidsonMottram02}, the switching is achieved though a
combination of flexoelectric behaviour and surface bistability. 
This is attempted here using a hybrid anchored slab of confined flexoelectric (pear shaped) 
particles homeotropically anchored on the top 
of the cell and with a homeotropic/planar bistable anchoring on the bottom.\\
This Chapter presents the steps undertaken in order to achieve both the easy and hard switching
routes between  the hybrid aligned nematic and vertical states of such a display.

\conclusion

In this Chapter, two issues have been addressed. First, the surface induced structural changes in
confined systems of PHGO pear shaped particles interacting with the surface through the RSUP
model have been studied, and bistability regions between the two surfaces arrangements have been
found using a surface parameter in the range $k_s \sim 0.7$. Also, it has been shown that 
this bistability behaviour can
be recovered at the bottom surface of an hybrid anchored slab with a top surface homeotropic
anchoring provided the latter is not too strong (\ie $k_{St} = 0.6$.)\\
Following this, switching between the HAN and vertical states of such a cell has been
investigated using a particle-field interaction containing both dielectric and dipolar
contributions. It has been shown that both easy and hard switching can be performed provided the
energy parameterisation is compatible with a window in both the electric field strength and
dipolar constant. Both switching direction can be achieved using $E = \pm 0.2\delta\epsilon$ and
$\mu = 2.5\delta\epsilon$.\\
%
Having achieved the two switching modes presented in~\cite{DavidsonMottram02}, with a molecular
model, it is apparent that there are several possible mechanisms underlying this switching. The
particle-particle and particle-field interactions used have been developed to allow the bulk
flexoelectric effects, considered in~\cite{DavidsonMottram02}, to play a role in the hard
switching. There is also, however, an implicit dipolar symmetry to the particle-substrate
interaction used in this work, which may also have played an important role in the simulations
presented in Sections~\ref{ss:easySwitch} and~\ref{ss:hardSwitch}. Resolving which of these
mechanisms is the dominant effect present in both these simulations and the real devices they
attempt to model, is beyond the scope of this Thesis; we do, however, comment in the general
conclusion Chapter possible steps to be taken to this end.
