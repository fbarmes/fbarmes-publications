The simulations did allow for box shape fluctuation: brief comments have been added in 
Sections 2.1.2 and 2.2.2 to clarify this. Additionally, an extra reference relating to
this technical issue (Reference [20]) has now been incorporated.

The abstract has been changed so as to refer to this phase as an interdigitated smectic A2.

We have also performed some further simulations (at higher pressures) so as to give a clearer 
characterisation  of this phase. These extra results have been incorporated into the manuscript by 
inserting an extra line to each of Figs 10a and 10b and by adding some text at the end of 
Section 2.2.3.
